# SMS Notification Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully added SMS/text message notifications as a third notification channel to your Claude Code hooks system.

### Key Components Created:

1. **SMS Handler** (`.claude/hooks/sms-notifications/handler.ts`)
   - Twilio integration for sending SMS
   - Daily limit tracking (stored in `.sms-daily-limit.json`)
   - Message priority filtering (only sends high-priority messages)
   - Dry-run mode for testing
   - Template-based message formatting

2. **Configuration** (`sms-mapping.json`)
   - Message templates for different events
   - Priority levels for each event type
   - Currently configured for:
     - Task completion (high priority)
     - Permission requests (high priority)
     - File operations (medium priority - not sent)

3. **Settings Integration**
   - Added SMS handler to all relevant hooks in `settings.json`
   - Pre-configured environment variables (disabled by default)
   - Twilio credentials placeholders

4. **Testing Support**
   - Updated `test-notifications.js` to include SMS tests
   - Fixed Windows-specific JSON escaping issues
   - Added SMS-specific test cases

5. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed README in SMS notifications folder
   - Updated main CLAUDE.md with SMS information
   - Setup instructions for Twilio

## Current Configuration

SMS is currently:
- **Disabled** by default (`SMS_ENABLED: "false"`)
- In **dry-run mode** (`SMS_DRY_RUN: "true"`)
- Limited to **10 messages per day**
- Only sends for **stop and notification** events
- Only sends **high priority** messages

## To Enable SMS Notifications:

1. Sign up for Twilio and get credentials
2. Update `.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   "SMS_ENABLED": "true",
   "SMS_DRY_RUN": "false",
   "SMS_FROM": "+1YourTwilioNumber",
   "SMS_TO": "+1RecipientNumber",
   "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID": "Your_Account_SID",
   "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "Your_Auth_Token"
   ```
3. Run `npm test` to verify

## Features Implemented:

✅ Twilio SMS integration
✅ Daily limit tracking (10 SMS/day default)
✅ Message priority filtering
✅ Dry-run mode for testing
✅ Template-based messages with variables
✅ Activity summary integration
✅ Cost control features
✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Per Your Feedback:

- ✅ Used Twilio (not email-to-SMS gateway)
- ✅ Removed rate limiting and message batching
- ✅ Kept only daily limit for cost control
- ✅ Added note about implementing filtering for other notifications

## Next Steps (Optional):

1. Add message filtering to audio and desktop notifications (as you mentioned)
2. Implement webhook for STOP replies
3. Add more granular event filtering
4. Create dashboard for SMS usage tracking
